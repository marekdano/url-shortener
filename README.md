# URL Shortener

## Main goals

The simple app to shorten long URLs and use them on the internet. The app can have similar functionality like [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) has.

The main purpose of this project is to have a first touch with open-source-software (OSS), prepare for technical interviews and improve coding skills along the way of developing this app.
